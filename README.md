- 👋 Hi, I’m @m0zzaR
- 👀 I’m interested in Compter Science and Engineering. Trying to learn as much as I can before college.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Calculus.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on as many cool projects as possible.
- 📫 Reach me on Discord: Mozza#8949


UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER: 
I am in college now attending UC Berkeley for Mechanical Engineering.
Still very interested in Computer Science, even more so than before!
I am currently taking a MATLAB class as well as trying to self teach myself C/C++ so I can use Windows API.
P.S. What is crazy is that I am updating this readme EXACTLY 2 years later. April 28 2021 - April 28 2023. I must be on some sort of internal coding clock haha.
